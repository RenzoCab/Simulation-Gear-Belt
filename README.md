##  Introduction

This repository contains all scripts utilized in _Experiment in robotic self-repair_. We construct a mathematical model to simulate the interaction between the rotation of a non-standard timing pulley and its associated timing belt. In the article, we show an experiment where a 3D printer shows some degrees of self-repair. Even when the capacity of a 3D printer to print some of its parts seems trivial, it becomes challenging when the printer presents some malfunctions.
