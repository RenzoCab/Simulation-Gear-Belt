##  Introduction

This repository contains all scripts utilized in _Experiment in robotic self-repair_. We construct a mathematical model to simulate the interaction between the rotation of a non-standard timing pulley and its associated timing belt. In the article, we show an experiment where a 3D printer reaches self-repair under some conditions. Even when the capacity of a 3D printer to print some of its parts seems trivial, it becomes challenging when the printer presents some malfunctions.

## Functions description

* circle(x,y,r,len): Plots a circle with center in (x,y), radius r, and LineWidth len.
